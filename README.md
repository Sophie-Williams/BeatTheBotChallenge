# BeatTheBot: Can humans still beat robots?

BeatTheBot is a challenge where humans compete against a robot to play the [AE 3D Motor](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/ae-3d-motor/bb5f1317-735d-4e60-a100-9c3f1692ee7c) mobile phone game.

The point of [AE 3D Motor](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/ae-3d-motor/bb5f1317-735d-4e60-a100-9c3f1692ee7c) is to accumulate points by driving a moto as fast and as long as possible while quickly tilting the phone left and right to zig-zag through trafic.

The robot is not simply some smart software: It plays the game just like you!

It is made of several parts:
* The servomotor is the arm, and is used to tilt the plank on which the mobile phone is laying
* The webcam is the eye, enabling the robot to see the moto, trafic, and phone borders
* An Arduino and a laptop, the two brains... yes the robot has a little advantage :)

By following the instructions on this page, you will be able to build your own robot. And if you're evil enough, you'll improve it to make the challenge even harder for humans :)

## But... why?

Because we can, of course!

## Events

Meet the robot and us at the following events:

* Lisbon Maker Faire, 18 + 19 + 20 September 2015 - TO BE CONFIRMED
* World Maker Faire New York, 26 & 27 September 2015 - TO BE CONFIRMED
